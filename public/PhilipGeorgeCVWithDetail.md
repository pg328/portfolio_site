## Introduction

<div class="role-summary">I'm Philip George, a full stack software engineer with just under <b>5 years</b> of industry experience — starting as hire #6 at <b>MetaDataWorks</b> and later helping SMEs like <b>Dunelm</b> scale their platforms.</div>
<br>
<div class="role-summary">At <b>MetaDataWorks</b>, I was the sole front-end developer on a medical-ontology browser for the NHS—running weekly demos with non-technical stakeholders to gather feedback and refine the UI until clinicians embraced it, which led to a <b>£1.2 million</b>, three-year contract. After a promotion, I led the front-end of our flagship <b>Metadata Browser</b> , delivering an accessibility overhaul to meet government standards and a full <b>JavaScript-to-TypeScript</b> migration to eliminate runtime errors and boost developer productivity. </div>
<br>

### Software Engineer, London <span class="spacer"></span> July 2023 &mdash; November 2023 (5 months - all internal engineers, HoE + most of C-Suite made redundant)

<p class="company-name">Disperse | London, England</p>

- Tasked with developing the 'Mark Up and Share' feature for an application, I selected and customized an NPM library, augmented the functions of a 3rd-party screenshot library, and resolved user-reported bugs, particularly with 360° image errors, resulting in the successful delivery of the feature in time for a stakeholder demo, receiving high praise for its seamless operation and ease of use.
- Independently managed 4 production releases, playing a key role in 10 additional releases, enhancing the application's performance and user experience without introducing any issues to end users.
- Joining a new company with a complex suite of SaaS applications, I rapidly familiarized myself with the technologies and frameworks involved, actively contributing to the development process, successfully adapting within the first three months and contributing effectively to development and deployment processes.
- Despite the contract non-renewal due to funding issues and market conditions, I owned and delivered key features, contributed to multiple production releases, and rapidly adapted to a new and complex codebase, leaving a strong impression as evidenced by positive reviews from colleagues.

### Full Stack Software Engineer <span class="spacer"></span> June 2022 &mdash; July 2023 (1 year 2 months)

<p class="company-name">Dunelm | London, England</p>

- Faced with the challenge of modernising a core part of the team's platform and integrating with other teams parallel modernisation, I designed and implemented a modernisation strategy by creating architecture diagrams, conducting team talks, and separating work into tickets (working with the team's Business Analyst), leading to the successful modernisation of the platform component, improving functionality and performance.
- Tasked with enhancing overall system efficiency inside of this modernisation, I developed a design that implemented server-side caching for the GraphQL backend, allowing data to be requested in one comprehensive call rather than multiple requests, which significantly increased system efficiency and streamlined data retrieval processes.
- Participating in industry conferences to stay abreast of new developments, I gathered and shared knowledge about the latest techniques and technologies in the React/TypeScript ecosystem with my team, enhancing team knowledge and accelerating progress for an innovative working environment.
- Recognizing the need for peer support in refactoring and developing new features, I engaged in pair programming, sharing best practices, especially emphasizing Test-Driven Development (TDD), contributing to the development of robust features and improving team efficiency and code quality.
