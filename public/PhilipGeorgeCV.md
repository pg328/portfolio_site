## Introduction

<div class="role-summary">I'm Philip George, a full stack software engineer with just under <b>5 years</b> of industry experience — starting as hire #6 at <b>MetaDataWorks</b> and later helping SMEs like <b>Dunelm</b> scale their platforms.</div>
<br>
<div class="role-summary">At <b>MetaDataWorks</b>, I was the sole front-end developer on a medical-ontology browser for the NHS—running weekly demos with non-technical stakeholders to gather feedback and refine the UI until clinicians embraced it, which led to a <b>£1.2 million</b>, three-year contract. After a promotion, I led the front-end of our flagship <b>Metadata Browser</b> , delivering an accessibility overhaul to meet government standards and a full <b>JavaScript-to-TypeScript</b> migration to eliminate runtime errors and boost developer productivity. </div>
<br>

## PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
